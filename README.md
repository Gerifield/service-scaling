# Scaling examples

This is the repo for my (Hungarian) Twitch streams where I speak a bit about scaling an application.

Each scale<num> folder more or less the same basic message board application, but I'll try to introduce new scaling methods and summarize the positive and negative sides of them.

Apps:

- `scale0/` - Basic application where you can save a message and then retrive the message list. Nothing special, just a simple MySQL database save an fetch.
